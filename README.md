# AutoHotkey_scripts

This is a depository of my personal use scripts and bits of code.

AutoHotkey is "a free and open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows ... providing easy keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys, fast macro-creation and software automation that allows users of most levels of computer skill to automate repetitive tasks in any Windows application."
